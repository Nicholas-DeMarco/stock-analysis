Analyzing Stocks and Finding Returns

  The purpose of this analysis was to find how much daily volume the stocks we are assessing are receiving. We are also looking to see which of these stocks performed the best or worst in the years 2017 and 2018.
  
  The first thing we wanted to do was find out how much daily volume our stocks were getting in 2017. Then we wanted our final outcome to be what the yearly return was on each of those stocks.
  
  Using the screenshot provided below, I am able to show you some of the code that was used to cycle through each stock ticker (ex. "AY" is the first ticker that appears on our list). In the simplest of terms, what this code is doing is going through each stock ticker and finding the starting and ending values of these stocks. In the end, the final return will be displayed as well to show us how our stocks did.

  By using this code, we are able to print out an easily legible data sheet showing us our results. Below is a picture of what the returns look like for the year 2017.

  To make it even easier, I added a couple buttons to make the process very easy. The "Run Analysis for All" button will return you a box that allows you to enter the which year you would like to see the return values of the stocks. The reason this button works is because I assigned a Macro that allows it to go through the entire code and return all of your wanted results with the click of a button. As you can see, the stocks did very well in the year 2017. "TERP" was our only stocks that had a negative return. Every other stock saw a positive return. "DQ" came in with our best return of 199.4%.
  
  Now we can also look at our stock results for the year 2018. Below is a picture of our final results for the year 2018.

  As you can see, our stocks did not do very well at all for the year 2018. There were only 2 stocks that saw a positive return in the year 2018. Those stocks were "ENPH" and "RUN".
  
  Summary of Refactoring Code for Analysis
  
  We used refactored code to complete our final analysis. The point of refactoring code is to help clean up some lines of code that you may be able to make easier to read and understand. So instead of having to re write an entire page of code, you may only have to replace certain lines of code to get your correct outcomes. It can be very time saving if you understand what parts of your code that you want to refactor.
  
  Some of the advantages of refactoring code can also be disadvantages. If you do not fully understand what parts of the code you want to/need to change, you can find yourself going in circles trying to figure out why your code is not working. You can run into new bugs and errors if you are not careful with refactoring your lines of code. This can lead to it becoming very time consuming.
